# -triply-

Triply is your all-in-one app for afforadble and authentic travel. Triply will prompt search for the cheapest option between flights with different airlines (Delta, United, American, etc), transportation with different ride share apps (Uber, Lyft, Bolt, Waymo, etc), and include AI-powered local recommendations to find the cheapest options that tailor to the unique cultural experience based on your specific interests and inputs. 


This project demonstrates:
- Flight comparison
- Ride-share comparison
- Local travel recommendations
- Flask web development
- Dynamic HTML rendering
- User form handling


## Files
 
- `testapp.py`
  - Test version of the app that utilizes real flight data, AI-powered local recommendations, and simulated ride-share data due to Terms of Service limitations.
  - Is the current local host prototype and showcases how Triply will appear.

- `README.md`
  - Project documentation and setup instructions

## Collaboration
This was a three person project between Efi, Denise, and Jan with the help of Generative AIs like ChatGPT and Claude. The Generative AIs wrote the bulk of the code, and we editied/revised in an iterative process to implement features, real flight data through SerpApi, and AI-powered local recommednations. Our Course Assistant, Chris, also assisted with guiding the trajectory of our project.


## Requirements

1. Install Dependencies

Install required Python packages:

pip install flask requests anthropic
2. Set API Keys

Triply requires API keys for full functionality.

Mac/Linux:

'export SERPAPI_KEY="your_key_here"'

Windows:

'set SERPAPI_KEY=your_key_here'

Anthropic (AI Recommendations)

Get a key from Anthropic and set:

Mac/Linux:

'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key_here"'

Windows:
